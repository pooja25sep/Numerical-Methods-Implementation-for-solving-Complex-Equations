# Numerical-Methods-Implementation-for-solving-Complex-Equations

* Implemented Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Trapezoidal methods for solving ODEs with
error analysis and comparison to standard techniques.
* Implementations of Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of complex equations and compared the
results with conventional methods.
